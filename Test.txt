## 🌟 ABOUT THE CHALLENGE
<p>In the distant future, space tourism will likely be routine for Earth dwellers. However, space travelers will need help choosing a destination and determining an itinerary. Imagine you are a travel agent at a future space tourism office. Your challenge is to create a tool that will develop not only customized itineraries for future travelers who want to visit the main bodies in our solar system—perhaps Mars, Jupiter, or Saturn—but also educate present-day users about the many different objects in our solar system.</p>
